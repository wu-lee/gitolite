<h2>deleting repos safely</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this page is about deleting <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/wildcard-repositories.html">user-created repos</a>.  It is
<strong>not</strong> about deleting "normal" repos (the kind that are specified in the
gitolite.conf file itself) -- to delete those read <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.html#_deleting_a_repo">here</a>.</p>

<p>(see <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/gitolite/browse_thread/thread/fb9cf5a464b6dfee">this thread</a> on the gitolite mailing list)</p>

<p>By default, the old 'rmrepo' ADC (admin-defined command) just went and deleted
the repo -- no questions asked!  Sometimes, that could be a disaster -- you
lose the whole thing in one mad moment of typo-ing or frustration.  Ouch.</p>

<p>This has been replaced by 2 families of ADCs.  I say "families" because each
has one main command and 2 ancillary ones.  Admins can choose to install
either, both, or neither family of commands.</p>

<p>Local settings for these ADCs can be found in the common settings file
"adc.common-functions".</p>

<ol>
<li><p>'rm' will remove the repo.  If <code>USE_LOCK_UNLOCK</code> is set, rm will refuse to
remove a locked repo.  All repos are locked by default, and you have to
explicitly 'unlock' a repo to remove it.  You can also 'lock' it again
instead of removing it of course.</p>

<p>There's also <code>ARE_YOU_SURE</code>, for situations where a simple warning
suffices.</p>

<p>You can also use both these flags if you wish.</p></li>
<li><p>'trash' will move the repo to a safe location.  There are settings for
where this location is and what suffix is added to the repo name.  You can
'list-trash' to see what trash you have collected, and you can 'restore'
one of the listed repos.</p>

<p>It's easy to automatically clean out the trash occasionally.  By default,
entries in the trash look like this:</p>

<pre><code>foo/r1/2010-10-22_13:14:24
foo/r1/2010-10-22_13:14:50
</code></pre>

<p>This shows a repo foo/r1 that was created and trashed twice.</p>

<p>Since the date appears in the name, you can use it with a cutoff to clean
up old repos.  Untested example:</p>

<pre><code>cutoff=`date -I -d '28 days ago'`
find $TRASH_CAN -type d -name "20??-??-??_*" | while read r
do
    d=`basename $r`
    [[ $d &lt; $cutoff ]] &amp;&amp; rm -rf $r
done
</code></pre>

<p>Put this in cron to run once a day and that should be it.</p></li>
</ol>
